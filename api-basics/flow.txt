The simple flow:
1. Testing the model pipeline: data split, train the model, test model, and handle prediction. If the model passes the Test, we can start to deploy on
API.
2. Init uvicorn to run API. Uvicorn is a web server useful to handle low-level network communication. It leaves us free to just handle the app logic. 
FastAPI uses Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface.
