There are 2 flows of testing:
1. Build the code > test it locally > success > manually deploy 
2. Build the code > pull request (deploy the code) > test on the staging area > success > code is deployed on live production

The last one often occurs on CI/CD workflow. The first one when the team is small. While automated, CI/CD workflow test has a greater risk if
the test doesnt robust enough. It deploys a potentially logic error code.
